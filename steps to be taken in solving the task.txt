1. Download the CSV file.
2. Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from the repository.
3. Analyze the CSV file to identify entities that could benefit from normalization.
4. Create a Python script to split the large CSV file into smaller, entity-based CSV files.
5. Load the smaller CSV files into the database.
6. Create relationships between tables using foreign keys.
7. Create indexes based on the foreign keys.
8. Develop stored procedures based on the requirements in the "Database Engineer: Coding Sample Instructions.pdf".
9. Adjust indexes according to the needs of the stored procedures.
10. Implement error handling within the procedures.
11. Encapsulate logic and structure procedure calls following the Single Responsibility Principle, including explanations with comments.
12. Testing:
    1. Run tests with expected (good) results.
    2. Run tests with no results.
    3. Run tests with incorrect input parameters.
13. Add the Python script, T-SQL script, smaller CSV files, and the database to GitHub.
